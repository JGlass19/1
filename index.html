        It was a hot summer day. A lion and a boar reach a small water body for a drink. They begin arguing and fighting 
        about who should drink first. After a while, they are tired and stop for breath, when they notice vultures above. 
        Soon they realize that the vultures are waiting for one or both of them
        to fall, to feast on them. The lion and the boar then decide that it was best to make up and be friends than fight and 
        become food for vultures. They drink the water together and go their ways after.
